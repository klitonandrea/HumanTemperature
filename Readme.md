# Human Temperature

It is a well known fact that the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees F. This experiment has been initially reported by Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich (4 August 1815 â€“ 25 September 1877). And the result is well know and accepted widely. 

In 1992 it was published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association revisiting the same experiment questioning whether the traditional estimate still holds true. 

This is a brief analysis of the data retrieved lately. It was concluded that traditional estimate is not in conjuction with the latest research. 

Estimated a new interval of normal body temperature.

It was of interest to conclude that there is a slight difference between the mean temperatures of males and females.
